# Dynamic Box Shadow

This is an example of a dynamic box shadow. As the title of this project implies, the box shadow of the the boxes (divs) will change respective to its location on the page. I accomplished this by using jquery for the drag event and to grab the position of the boxes as they are dragged around.
